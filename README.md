## About
This is an OSX app written in Swift to create PDF files for "Print and Play" Word Scramble puzzles.

## Use
I still run from OSX since I have not dealt with filepaths well yet.
The directory where the PDF files are saved will be printed to the consolle.

Roughly speaking:
/Users/<CurrentUser>/Library/Containers/<BundleIdentifier>/Data/<filename>_<saveCount>_solved.pdf
/Users/<CurrentUser>/Library/Containers/<BundleIdentifier>/Data/<filename>_<saveCount>_puzzle.pdf
